# Quantum Computation handled by Smart Contracts
Democratise Access to specialised hardware like quantum computers. Upload your [Open- QASM](https://openqasm.com) circuit to the Dapp, calculate the cost of the computation and call the smart contract to add the circuit. This triggers a series of API calls which ultimately reaches the level of an IBM quantum computer. The result is posted on-chain along with the hash of the quantum circuit making it a privacy preserving computation and allowing the user to execute conditional logic based on the result of the computation. This also makes the compuation more efficient insofar as circuits that have already been executed in past have a result associated with them which can always be fetched seamleslly without re-running the computation.
